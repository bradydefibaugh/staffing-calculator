# Staffing Calculator  \n\nThis project provides a simple staffing calculator that helps determine the optimal number of staff required based on workload, productivity, and cost considerations.  \n\n## Getting Started  \n\n- Clone the repository:  \n  `git clone https://github.com/bradydefibaugh/staffing-calculator.git`  \n\n- Run the calculator:  \n  `python calculator.py`  \n\nThe script includes example usage in the `__main__` block. You can modify the `required_hours`, `hours_per_employee`, and `hourly_rate` variables to suit your scenario.  \n\n## Functions  \n\n- `calculate_staff(required_hours, hours_per_employee)` – Returns the minimum number of staff needed to complete the required workload.  \n\n- `calculate_cost(num_staff, hourly_rate, hours_per_employee)` – Calculates the total cost of staffing based on the number of staff, hourly rate, and hours per employee.  \n\n## License  \n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License.
